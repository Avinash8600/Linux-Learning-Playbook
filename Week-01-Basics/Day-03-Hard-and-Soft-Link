# 🐧 Day 3 – Understanding **Hard Links** & **Soft Links**

## 📌 **Objective**
To understand how Linux links work at the filesystem level by exploring the differences between **Soft (Symbolic) Links** and **Hard Links**, along with practical command-line demonstrations.

## 🔹 **Soft Link (Symbolic Link)**
A **soft link** acts like a shortcut that points to the **file path** of the original file.  
**Command Used:** `ln -s Myfile.txt softlink`  
**Verification:** `ls`, `cat softlink`  
**Observations:** The symbolic link appears alongside the original file; accessing the soft link displays the same content as the original file; if the original file is deleted, the soft link becomes broken.  
**Key Points:** Soft links reference the **file path**; work across **different filesystems**; similar to **shortcuts in Windows**; **dependent** on the original file’s existence.

## 🔹 **Hard Link**
A **hard link** directly points to the **same inode (actual data)** on disk.  
**Command Used:** `ln File.txt hardlink-file`  
**Verification:** `ls`, `cat hardlink-file`  
**Observations:** Both filenames appear as **independent files**; both point to the **same underlying data**; deleting one filename does **not** remove the data.  
**Key Points:** Hard links share the **same inode**; cannot cross **different filesystems**; changes via one link **reflect in the other**; data exists as long as **at least one hard link remains**.

## 🔁 **Soft Link vs Hard Link**
**Soft Link:** references **file path**, crosses filesystem ✅, breaks if original deleted ✅, inode shared ❌  
**Hard Link:** references **inode**, crosses filesystem ❌, breaks if original deleted ❌, inode shared ✅

## 🧠 **Learning Outcome**
This exercise helped me understand how Linux manages **files internally**, the role of **inodes** in filesystem design, and why links are important in **real-world Linux systems**. Some days are about **depth, not speed** 🚀 This topic strengthened my foundation for **advanced Linux concepts**.
