# Day 01 – Introduction to Linux & Ubuntu 🐧

## Overview
This marks Day 1 of my Linux (Ubuntu) learning journey.  
The focus today was on getting comfortable with the Linux environment, understanding what Linux is, and starting hands-on practice with the terminal.

This playbook documents practical learning aimed at building strong foundations for system, cloud, and DevOps roles.

## 🛠️ Environment Setup
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Platform:** VirtualBox
- **Interface:** Terminal-centric usage

Using a virtual machine allows safe experimentation without affecting the host system.
